# Boingcoin
BoingCoin is a coin created by a 15-year-old with too much time and nothing to do, so don't expect much, but do.

# How-To
There are two branches, "Windows" and "Linux". 

If you are on linux, you can download the linux branch, and navigate to the folder that cointains "boingcoin-qt" in the terminal. Run this command (without the quotes): "./boingcoin-qt". This will launch the boingcoin wallet system, and as I'll get to later, mining.

If you are on Windows, download the Windows branch, launch the "boingcoin-qt.exe" file. This will put you directly into the boingcoin interface, and will begin downloading the transaction history.

#Mining
To mine, you don't need any extra tools. You can use your client that you have already downloaded, go the "Help" dropdown menu near the top, and click "Debug Window". Once you arrive there, you can click on the "console" tab, and input the command "setgenerate true" without the quotes. This will immediately start mining, and you can collect data on your mining by typing the command "getminginginfo" without the quotes. Now you're all setup.

#Roadmap
The current roadmap outlines the oncoming setup of a mining pool, and links to where you can set one up for yourself if you please. Next on the roadmap would be to make a website where you could buy physical items from each other for Boingcoin.
